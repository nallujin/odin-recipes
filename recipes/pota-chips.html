  <h2>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last long!</h2>
  <p>Experiment with the thickness; you may like them thicker or thinner.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 medium potatoes, peeled, and sliced paper-thin</li>
    <li>3 tablespoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>1 quart oil for deep-frying</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Transfer potato slices to a large bowl of cold water as you slice them.</li>
    <li>Drain slices and rinse under cold water. Refill the bowl with water, add 3 tablespoons salt, and put slices back in the bowl. Let potatoes soak in the salty water for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Drain and rinse slices again. Pat dry.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Working in small batches, fry potato slices until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Continue until all the slices are fried.</li>
    <li>Season potato chips with additional salt if desired.</li>
  </ol>
